# üéì Campus Exchange ‚Äî Student Resource Sharing Platform

## Overview
Campus Exchange is a full‚Äëstack web application that enables students to list, lend, sell, and borrow academic resources (textbooks, lab kits, stationery, notes) within a campus network. The platform delivers secure authentication, transaction workflows, and realtime messaging backed by a normalized PostgreSQL schema and cloud storage. It is built for production deployment on Vercel with Supabase as the backend platform.

The app connects students as owners and requesters to streamline peer‚Äëto‚Äëpeer exchanges with transparency and auditability.

## Key Highlights
- Secure account system with Supabase Auth and protected dashboard
- Resource listings with images, categories, pricing/type, and availability
- Transaction workflow with owner actions (Accept/Reject) and automatic inventory state updates
- Realtime, transaction‚Äëscoped messaging using Supabase Realtime
- Activity logging (activity_log) to capture key user actions
- Responsive dashboard UI with collapsible sidebar and consistent layouts

## Project Development Steps
1. Requirements and UX flows for listing, messaging, and transactions
2. Database schema design (6 tables) and storage buckets
3. Authentication integration and route protection
4. Resource CRUD with image uploads and category taxonomy
5. Transaction lifecycle with availability sync and activity logs
6. Realtime messaging UI with scroll‚Äësynced panes
7. Vercel deployment with environment‚Äëdriven configuration

## Architecture
- Frontend: Next.js (App Router), React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- Server: Next.js server components and route handlers
- Backend: Supabase (Auth, PostgreSQL, Storage, Realtime)
- Infra: Vercel hosting and CDN

High‚Äëlevel flow:
1. Users sign in via Supabase Auth
2. Owners create resources with images and availability
3. Requesters initiate transactions; owners Accept/Reject
4. On Accept, the linked resource availability_status ‚Üí ‚Äúunavailable‚Äù
5. Parties chat in realtime within the transaction thread
